  (text "V0.0.2 - Removed 10k resistor between SJ5 and SIG_EMCYSTOP.  Would have prevented ESTOP signal from going high with mini mainboard resistor divider circuit. \n         Corrected mini mainboard symbol voltage on throttle input to 0-6.6v (V2 bottom right corner,) also corrected in notes.\n\nV0.0.3 - L2 was (C1046) a 10uH 0805 but only 15ma.  Changed to a Sunlord 4030 / 4.0mmx4.0mm inductor footprint."
